```

## Setting up server

To start wertik-js server you need to import wertik and start it:

```js
import wertik from "wertik-js/lib/next"

weritk({
  port: 1200,
})
```

In your console you will see something like this:

```log
Wertik JS app listening at http://localhost:1200
```

If you visit [http://localhost:1200](http://localhost:1200), you will see a response like this:

```log
Cannot GET /
```

ðŸš€ You have successfully started wertik server. There is nothing in wertik app right now. Let's make it interactive by adding:

- MySQL Database
- Mailer
- GraphQL
- Modules
- Rest Api
- Storage
- Sockets
- Cron Jobs
- Redis

## Accessing Wertik Inside GraphQL Resolver and Express Handler

You can access Wertik instance inside GraphQL and Express handler through:

- Express

```javascript
app.get("/somepath", (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.wertik) // Wertik App
  res.send("Some Info")
})
```

- GraphQL Resolver

```javascript
function Resolver(_, args, context, info) => {
  console.log(context.wertik); // Wertik App
  return "Some Info"
}
```
